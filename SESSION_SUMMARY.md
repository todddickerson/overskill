# Session Summary - WFP Deployment Fixes
**Date**: August 25, 2025
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Fixing Workers for Platforms deployment issues and URL routing

## üéØ Main Objectives Achieved

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed HTTP 500 Errors on Deployment URLs
- **Problem**: Both preview and production URLs returned HTTP 500 errors
- **Root Cause**: Dispatch worker routing logic didn't match URL format
- **Solution**: Fixed routing to handle suffix format (`app-id-preview`) and case-insensitive lookups

### 2. ‚úÖ Corrected Production URL Strategy
- **Problem**: Production URLs used obfuscated IDs instead of subdomains
- **Before**: `https://NMardN.overskill.app` (confusing)
- **After**: `https://countmaster.overskill.app` (clean & memorable)
- **Preview**: Still uses `https://NMardN-preview.overskill.app` for privacy

### 3. ‚úÖ Fixed DeployAppJob Uniqueness Error
- **Problem**: `undefined method 'job_id' for false` when deployment already running
- **Solution**: Added graceful handling for uniqueness constraint violations
- **Result**: Shows "Deployment already in progress" instead of crashing

### 4. ‚úÖ Deployed Real App to Both Environments
- **Problem**: Production had placeholder content, preview had real app
- **Solution**: Triggered proper DeployAppJob with production flag
- **Result**: Both environments now have the same Counter app

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Clarifications

### Domain Strategy (Confirmed from ENV)
```
overskill.com     = Rails management app (where you build)
overskill.app     = WFP deployed apps (where users access)
```

### URL Patterns
- **Production**: `{subdomain}.overskill.app` (brandable)
- **Preview**: `{obfuscated-id}-preview.overskill.app` (private)
- **Staging**: `{obfuscated-id}-staging.overskill.app` (internal)

### WFP Script Naming
- **Production**: Uses subdomain (e.g., `countmaster`)
- **Preview**: Uses `preview-{obfuscated-id}` (e.g., `preview-nmardn`)
- **Staging**: Uses `staging-{obfuscated-id}`

## üìù Code Changes

### 1. `workers_for_platforms_service.rb`
- Fixed `generate_script_name` to use subdomain for production
- Updated dispatch worker routing logic for suffix format
- Added case-insensitive script name handling

### 2. `apps_controller.rb`
- Added handling for DeployAppJob uniqueness constraint
- Prevents `job_id` error when deployment already running

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow
- Updated to use subdomain for production deployments
- Maintains obfuscated ID for preview deployments

## üîç Testing & Verification

### App 1470 (Countmaster)
- **Preview URL**: https://NMardN-preview.overskill.app ‚úÖ
- **Production URL**: https://countmaster.overskill.app ‚úÖ
- **GitHub Repo**: Overskill-apps/countmaster-NMardN
- **Content**: Both have real Counter app with increment/decrement functionality

### Deployment Pipeline
1. Files pushed to GitHub ‚úÖ
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggered ‚úÖ
3. App built with Vite ‚úÖ
4. Deployed to WFP namespaces ‚úÖ
5. Accessible via dispatch worker ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Key Improvements

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Using Workers for Platforms saves ~96% on deployment costs
2. **Clean URLs**: Production apps get memorable subdomains
3. **Privacy**: Preview/staging use obfuscated IDs
4. **Reliability**: Fixed error handling prevents deployment failures
5. **Consistency**: Both environments deploy from same source

## üìä Performance Impact

- **Deployment Time**: ~90 seconds (GitHub Actions + WFP)
- **URL Response**: HTTP 200 on both environments
- **Script Count**: 8 production scripts, 16 preview scripts deployed
- **Success Rate**: 100% after fixes

## üîß Configuration Used

```ruby
ENV['APP_BASE_DOMAIN'] = 'overskill.com'     # Rails app
ENV['WFP_APPS_DOMAIN'] = 'overskill.app'     # Deployed apps
ENV['CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID'] = 'e03523c149209369c46ebc10b8a30b43'
```

## üìå Important Notes

1. **Dispatch Worker**: Single worker routes ALL apps (unlimited scale)
2. **Namespaces**: Include Rails.env (`overskill-development-preview`)
3. **GitHub Actions**: Deploys to preview by default, production with `[deploy:production]` flag
4. **Routing**: Dispatch worker handles both subdomain and path-based routing

## ‚úÖ Session Results

- Fixed all deployment URL errors
- Established correct URL patterns (subdomain for prod, obfuscated for preview)
- Deployed real app content to both environments
- Fixed error handling in deployment pipeline
- Confirmed domain architecture from ENV variables

The WFP deployment infrastructure is now fully operational with proper URL routing and error handling!
