## üöÄ Enabling Real Browser Testing

This report shows simulated test results. To enable real browser testing:

1. **Ensure Playwright MCP is available** in your Claude Code environment
2. **Replace simulation methods** in PlaywrightMcpService with actual MCP calls:
   ```ruby
   def navigate(url)
     mcp__playwright__playwright_navigate(url: url)
   end

   def fill_field(selector, value)
     mcp__playwright__playwright_fill(selector: selector, value: value)
   end

   def click_element(selector)
     mcp__playwright__playwright_click(selector: selector)
   end
   ```
3. **Add data-testid attributes** to your HTML elements for reliable selection
4. **Run tests with**: `Testing::PlaywrightMcpService.new.run_golden_flow_tests`
