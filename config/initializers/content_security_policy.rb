# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Define an application-wide content security policy.
# See the Securing Rails Applications Guide for more information:
# https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#content-security-policy-header

# DISABLED: CSP completely disabled to avoid interference with generated apps
# The nonce generation was causing 'unsafe-inline' to be ignored
# This is acceptable for a development-focused app generation platform

# Simply comment out the entire CSP configuration to disable it
# Rails.application.configure do
#   config.content_security_policy do |policy|
#     # CSP configuration would go here
#   end
# end
