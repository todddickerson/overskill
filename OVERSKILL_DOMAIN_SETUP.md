# OverSkill.com Custom Domain Setup for WFP
**Date**: January 20, 2025  
**Purpose**: Enable subdomain-style URLs for Workers for Platforms

## Overview

Setting up `*.overskill.com` will enable each app to have a unique-looking subdomain:
- `abc123.overskill.com` (Production)
- `preview-abc123.overskill.com` (Preview)  
- `staging-abc123.overskill.com` (Staging)

All subdomains route through the single dispatch worker but appear as individual URLs.

## DNS Configuration Steps

### 1. Add Cloudflare Zone (if not already done)
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Add `overskill.com` as a zone
3. Update nameservers at domain registrar

### 2. Create Wildcard CNAME Record
Add DNS record in Cloudflare:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: *
Target: overskill-dispatch.toddspontentcomsaccount.workers.dev
Proxy: üü† Proxied (Orange Cloud)
TTL: Auto
```

### 3. Add Custom Domain Route in Workers
In Cloudflare Dashboard > Workers & Pages > overskill-dispatch:
1. Go to Settings > Triggers
2. Add Custom Domain: `*.overskill.com`
3. This connects all subdomains to the dispatch worker

### 4. Configure SSL Certificate
Cloudflare automatically generates wildcard SSL certificates for `*.overskill.com`

## Testing the Setup

### 1. Verify DNS Resolution
```bash
# Test that subdomains resolve to Cloudflare
nslookup test123.overskill.com
# Should show Cloudflare IP addresses
```

### 2. Test Dispatch Worker Routing
```bash
# Test landing page
curl https://test123.overskill.com

# Should return dispatch worker landing page with routing info
```

### 3. Test Customer Script Routing
```bash
# Test actual app (after deploying a test script)
curl https://jlxxrj.overskill.com
# Should route to customer script in WFP namespace
```

## URL Migration Strategy

### Current State (Path-based)
```
https://overskill-dispatch.toddspontentcomsaccount.workers.dev/app/jlxxrj
```

### Target State (Subdomain-style) 
```
https://jlxxrj.overskill.com
```

### Migration Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Set up DNS and test routing
2. **Phase 2**: Update WorkersForPlatformsService to generate overskill.com URLs
3. **Phase 3**: Update App Builder UI to show new URLs
4. **Phase 4**: Keep workers.dev as fallback for development

## Code Changes Required

### Update Default URL Generation
In `WorkersForPlatformsService`:
```ruby
def generate_app_url(script_name, environment)
  # Switch to subdomain-style as primary
  "https://#{script_name}.overskill.com"
end
```

### Update App Model URLs
Add migration to update existing app URLs:
```ruby
# Update all apps to use overskill.com URLs
App.find_each do |app|
  next unless app.obfuscated_id.present?
  
  script_name = app.obfuscated_id.downcase
  app.update!(
    production_url: "https://#{script_name}.overskill.com",
    preview_url: "https://preview-#{script_name}.overskill.com",
    staging_url: "https://staging-#{script_name}.overskill.com"
  )
end
```

## Benefits After Setup

### Professional URLs
‚úÖ `abc123.overskill.com` vs ‚ùå `dispatch-worker.account.workers.dev/app/abc123`

### SEO Advantages
- Each app appears to have its own domain
- Better search engine indexing
- Professional appearance for users

### Branding Consistency
- All URLs under overskill.com domain
- Consistent with main platform branding
- Easier to market and explain

## Monitoring

### DNS Propagation
- Check DNS propagation globally: https://dnschecker.org
- Test from different locations

### SSL Certificate Status
- Verify wildcard certificate in Cloudflare SSL/TLS tab
- Test HTTPS on various subdomains

### Worker Performance
- Monitor dispatch worker metrics in Cloudflare Analytics
- Check routing success rates

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert URL generation back to path-based:
```ruby
def generate_app_url(script_name, environment)
  # Rollback to path-based routing
  dispatch_url = "https://overskill-dispatch.#{get_account_subdomain}.workers.dev"
  "#{dispatch_url}/app/#{script_name}"
end
```

DNS changes are non-destructive and can be removed easily.

## Estimated Timeline

- **DNS Setup**: 5 minutes
- **DNS Propagation**: 2-24 hours globally  
- **Testing**: 1 hour
- **Code Updates**: 2 hours
- **Migration**: 1 hour

**Total**: ~1 day for complete setup and migration

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ `test123.overskill.com` resolves to dispatch worker  
‚úÖ Dispatch worker correctly routes subdomain requests  
‚úÖ Customer apps accessible via subdomain URLs  
‚úÖ SSL certificates working for all subdomains  
‚úÖ Existing apps updated with new URLs
