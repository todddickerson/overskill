# Streaming Tool Execution Fixes - August 28, 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical issues preventing proper real-time text streaming and tool execution in the incremental streaming system. Text now streams immediately as it arrives, tools execute in parallel, and the AI continues conversation after tools complete.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Text Streaming Variable Scope Issue
**File:** `app/services/ai/app_builder_v5.rb` (lines 1685-1759)
**Problem:** Text wasn't streaming during tool execution, only appearing after tools completed
**Cause:** Lambda closure couldn't access local variable `content_added_to_flow`
**Solution:** Changed to hash pattern for proper closure access

```ruby
# Before (broken):
content_added_to_flow = false
on_text: ->(text_chunk) {
  if !content_added_to_flow  # Variable not accessible in lambda
    # ...
  end
}

# After (working):
content_state = { added: false }
on_text: ->(text_chunk) {
  if !content_state[:added]  # Hash accessible in lambda
    # ...
  end
}
```

### 2. Missing Public Methods for Completion Job
**File:** `app/services/ai/incremental_tool_coordinator.rb`
**Problem:** IncrementalToolCompletionJob couldn't access necessary methods
**Solution:** Made methods public

```ruby
# Added public methods:
def get_execution_state(execution_id)
  Rails.cache.read(cache_key(execution_id, 'state'))
end

def collect_results_for_execution(execution_id)
  state = get_execution_state(execution_id)
  return [] unless state && state['tools']
  results = []
  state['tools'].each do |index, tool|
    tool_result_key = cache_key(execution_id, "tool_#{index}_result")
    result = Rails.cache.read(tool_result_key)
    results[index.to_i] = result if result
  end
  results
end
```

### 3. Private Method Access Errors
**File:** `app/services/ai/app_builder_v5.rb`
**Problem:** `continue_incremental_conversation` was private
**Solution:** Removed private declaration to make method public

### 4. Wrong Tool Service Method
**File:** `app/services/ai/app_builder_v5.rb` (line 1905)
**Problem:** Called non-existent method `Ai::AiToolService.tools_for_chat_with_claude`
**Solution:** Changed to use correct method

```ruby
# Before:
tools = Ai::AiToolService.tools_for_chat_with_claude

# After:
tools = @prompt_service.generate_tools
```

### 5. Test Script Issues
**File:** `scripts/test_fixed_streaming.rb`
**Problem:** Message wasn't being created with proper attributes
**Solution:** Added role field and persistence check

```ruby
msg = app.app_chat_messages.create!(
  user: User.first,
  role: 'user',  # Added required role
  content: "Create a simple header component..."
)
raise "Message not persisted!" unless msg.persisted?
```

## Testing

### Test Script
Created `scripts/test_fixed_streaming.rb` to validate all fixes:
```bash
bin/rails runner scripts/test_fixed_streaming.rb
```

### Monitor Commands
```bash
# Text streaming
tail -f log/development.log | grep -E 'V5_INCREMENTAL.*Text chunk|Added streaming text'

# Tool execution  
tail -f log/development.log | grep -E 'INCREMENTAL_DIRECT.*executing|tool.*completed'

# Completion
tail -f log/development.log | grep -E 'INCREMENTAL_COMPLETION.*Status|All tools completed'
```

## Results
✅ Text now streams immediately when chunks arrive
✅ Text appears BEFORE tool execution, not after
✅ Tools execute in parallel without blocking
✅ AI continues conversation after tools complete
✅ Proper error handling and recovery

## Key Log Indicators
- `[V5_INCREMENTAL] Text chunk received, total length: N` - Text streaming working
- `[V5_INCREMENTAL] Added streaming text to conversation_flow` - Text added to UI
- `[INCREMENTAL_DIRECT] Tool N executing directly` - Tools executing in parallel
- `[INCREMENTAL_COMPLETION] All tools completed, continuing conversation` - Proper continuation

## Architecture Notes
The incremental streaming system uses:
1. **SSE streaming** for real-time text chunks
2. **Direct execution** instead of background jobs for tools
3. **Redis caching** for execution state management
4. **IncrementalToolCompletionJob** for async continuation
5. **ActionCable** for UI updates

## Future Considerations
- Monitor logo generation for potential blocking (user reported this may block other tools)
- Consider batching tool executions for better performance
- Add more granular progress indicators for long-running tools
