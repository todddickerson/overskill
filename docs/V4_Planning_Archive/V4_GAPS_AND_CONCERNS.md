# V4 Implementation: Critical Gaps and Concerns

## 🔴 Critical Gaps to Address

### 1. **Node.js Build Environment**
**Gap**: Where and how does Vite build actually run?
- Need containerized build environment (Docker?)
- npm install caching strategy unclear
- Build timeout handling missing
- Resource limits for builds undefined

**Questions**:
- Use AWS Lambda, ECS, or local Docker for builds?
- How to cache node_modules between builds?
- What if npm install fails or times out?
- Memory/CPU limits for build processes?

### 2. **Database Migration Strategy**
**Gap**: How do existing apps migrate to app-scoped tables?
- No migration script defined
- RLS policy creation timing unclear
- Rollback strategy missing
- Data migration for existing apps undefined

**Questions**:
- Do we migrate existing data or start fresh?
- Who runs CREATE TABLE and RLS policies?
- When do migrations run - build time or deploy time?
- How to handle failed migrations?

### 3. **Local Development Workflow**
**Gap**: How do developers work locally with this architecture?
- Vite dev server + Cloudflare Worker mismatch
- App-scoped database in local development
- Environment variable management across environments
- Hot reload with Worker constraints

**Questions**:
- Use Miniflare for local Worker development?
- Local Supabase instance or shared dev database?
- How to sync .env files across environments?
- Can we achieve hot reload with Workers?

### 4. **Template Versioning & Storage**
**Gap**: Where and how are shared templates managed?
- Storage location undefined (Git? Database? S3?)
- Version control strategy missing
- Update propagation to existing apps unclear
- TypeScript types for app-scoped DB wrapper not defined

**Questions**:
- Store templates in main Rails app or separate repo?
- How to version templates (semver)?
- Should existing apps auto-update templates?
- Generate .d.ts files for TypeScript support?

### 5. **Error Recovery & Monitoring**
**Gap**: No comprehensive error handling strategy
- Build failure recovery undefined
- Deployment rollback missing
- Worker crash handling unclear
- Real-time monitoring not specified

**Questions**:
- Automatic retry on build failure?
- Blue-green deployments for zero downtime?
- How to monitor Worker errors in production?
- Alert thresholds for performance degradation?

## 🟡 Technical Concerns

### 1. **Claude 4 Integration Details**
**Concern**: Conversation loop implementation for multi-file generation
```ruby
# How exactly do we handle this?
def generate_with_claude_conversation
  # Claude creates 1-2 files per call
  # Need to maintain context across calls
  # How to handle partial failures?
end
```

### 2. **Worker Size Monitoring**
**Concern**: Need real-time tracking before hitting limits
```javascript
// Need metrics for:
- Current worker size
- Asset distribution (embedded vs R2)
- Size growth over time
- Alerts before hitting 1MB limit
```

### 3. **Secret Management**
**Concern**: Complex secret handling across environments
```yaml
Secrets needed:
- Supabase keys (per shard)
- Cloudflare API tokens
- OpenAI/Anthropic keys
- App-specific secrets
- OAuth credentials
```

### 4. **Build Performance**
**Concern**: Build times could exceed targets with large apps
- npm install: 30-60s
- Vite build: 20-45s
- Asset optimization: 15-30s
- Total could exceed 2 minutes

## 🟠 Process Questions

### 1. **Deployment Pipeline**
- **Q**: What triggers production deployment?
- **Q**: How do we handle staging environments?
- **Q**: Can users preview before production?
- **Q**: Rollback strategy for bad deploys?

### 2. **Database Lifecycle**
- **Q**: When are app tables created?
- **Q**: Who manages RLS policies?
- **Q**: How to handle schema migrations?
- **Q**: Cleanup for deleted apps?

### 3. **Cost Tracking**
- **Q**: How to measure cost per app?
- **Q**: Alert when app exceeds tier limits?
- **Q**: R2 storage cost attribution?
- **Q**: Worker compute cost tracking?

### 4. **Multi-tenancy Concerns**
- **Q**: Table name collision handling?
- **Q**: Supabase project limits (500 tables)?
- **Q**: Connection pooling strategy?
- **Q**: Rate limiting per app?

## 🔵 Integration Challenges

### 1. **V3 to V4 Migration**
```ruby
# Need migration strategy:
- Existing apps on V3
- No downtime during migration
- Preserve git history
- Update deployment pipeline
```

### 2. **AI Model Coordination**
```ruby
# Complex orchestration needed:
- Claude 4 for initial generation
- GPT-5 for batch operations
- Fallback strategies
- Token optimization across models
```

### 3. **Testing Strategy**
```ruby
# Missing test plans for:
- Hybrid asset optimization
- App-scoped database operations
- Build pipeline failures
- Worker size limits
- Multi-model AI generation
```

## ✅ Recommendations Before Starting

### 1. **Immediate Decisions Needed**
- [ ] Choose build environment (Lambda vs ECS vs Docker)
- [ ] Define RLS policy creation strategy
- [ ] Select template storage method
- [ ] Decide on monitoring stack

### 2. **Prototype First**
- [ ] Build simple POC with one template
- [ ] Test full pipeline end-to-end
- [ ] Measure actual build times
- [ ] Verify Worker size limits

### 3. **Document Critical Paths**
- [ ] Build failure recovery flow
- [ ] Deployment rollback procedure
- [ ] Database migration scripts
- [ ] Secret rotation process

### 4. **Setup Infrastructure**
- [ ] Containerized build environment
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Cost tracking system
- [ ] Error reporting pipeline

## 🎯 Success Criteria for V4 Launch

Before considering V4 ready:
1. **Build Pipeline**: < 45s dev, < 3min prod consistently
2. **Worker Size**: 100% compliance with 1MB limit
3. **Database**: App-scoping working with RLS
4. **Templates**: Shared foundation generating correctly
5. **AI Integration**: Claude 4 + conversation loop working
6. **Monitoring**: Full visibility into all metrics
7. **Documentation**: Complete setup and troubleshooting guides
8. **Testing**: 90% coverage of critical paths
9. **Migration**: Clear path from V3 to V4
10. **Rollback**: Tested rollback procedures

## 🚨 Highest Risk Items

1. **Supabase Table Limits**: 500 tables per project = ~50 apps max
   - **Mitigation**: Multiple Supabase projects (sharding)

2. **Build Environment Costs**: Running Node.js builds could be expensive
   - **Mitigation**: Aggressive caching, build optimization

3. **Claude 4 Rate Limits**: Conversation loop could hit API limits
   - **Mitigation**: Implement backoff, use GPT-5 fallback

4. **Worker Size Violations**: Apps could suddenly exceed 1MB
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous monitoring, automatic optimization

5. **Database Migration Failures**: Could lose user data
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backups, tested migrations
