# Fast Deployment Production Rollout Plan

## Executive Summary
Phased rollout of the Fast Deployment Architecture to production, enabling sub-10s preview deployments with hot module reloading for all OverSkill users.

**Target Date**: September 16-30, 2025  
**Risk Level**: Medium (with fallback options)  
**Rollback Time**: <5 minutes

## Pre-Production Checklist

### Infrastructure Requirements
- [ ] Redis cluster configured for ActionCable at scale
- [ ] Cloudflare Workers for Platforms quota increased
- [ ] ESBuild installed on all production servers
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured (Datadog/New Relic)
- [ ] Error tracking integrated (Sentry)
- [ ] CDN cache rules configured

### Code Readiness
- [ ] All Phase 1 components tested (see FAST_DEPLOYMENT_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)
- [ ] Database migrations deployed
- [ ] Feature flags configured
- [ ] Rollback scripts prepared
- [ ] Performance baselines established

## Rollout Phases

### Phase 0: Internal Testing (September 10-12)
**Scope**: OverSkill team only (5-10 users)

#### Day 1: Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
RAILS_ENV=staging bin/rails deploy:fast_preview

# Run smoke tests
bin/rails test:fast_deployment

# Monitor metrics
tail -f log/staging.log | grep -E "FastBuild|HMR|EdgePreview"
```

#### Day 2-3: Team Testing
- [ ] Each team member creates 3 test apps
- [ ] Test HMR with various file types
- [ ] Stress test with rapid updates
- [ ] Document any issues found

### Phase 1: Beta Users (September 13-16)
**Scope**: 10% of users (~50 users)

#### Enabling Beta
```ruby
# Enable for beta users
User.where(beta_tester: true).update_all(
  fast_deployment_enabled: true
)

# Monitor adoption
Rails.cache.fetch("beta_preview_sessions", expires_in: 1.hour) do
  User.where(fast_deployment_enabled: true).count
end
```

#### Success Metrics
- [ ] Preview deployment P50 < 10s
- [ ] HMR success rate > 95%
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] User satisfaction > 4/5

### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (September 17-23)
**Scope**: Progressive rollout to all users

#### Day 1: 25% of Users
```ruby
# Enable for 25% using feature flag
Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors(:fast_deployment, 25)
```

#### Day 3: 50% of Users
```ruby
# Increase if metrics are good
if deployment_metrics_healthy?
  Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors(:fast_deployment, 50)
end
```

#### Day 5: 75% of Users
```ruby
# Continue rollout
Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors(:fast_deployment, 75)
```

#### Day 7: 100% of Users
```ruby
# Full rollout
Flipper.enable(:fast_deployment)
```

### Phase 3: Cleanup (September 24-30)
**Scope**: Remove old deployment code

- [ ] Remove legacy GitHub Actions deployment code
- [ ] Archive old deployment services
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Training videos for support team

## Monitoring Plan

### Key Metrics Dashboard
```ruby
# app/dashboards/fast_deployment_metrics.rb
class FastDeploymentMetrics
  def self.current_stats
    {
      preview_deployments: {
        count: AppDeployment.preview.where('created_at > ?', 1.hour.ago).count,
        p50: calculate_percentile(50),
        p95: calculate_percentile(95),
        p99: calculate_percentile(99)
      },
      hmr_updates: {
        total: Rails.cache.read("hmr_updates_count") || 0,
        success_rate: calculate_hmr_success_rate,
        avg_latency: calculate_avg_hmr_latency
      },
      websocket_connections: {
        active: ActionCable.server.connections.count,
        peak: Rails.cache.read("peak_websocket_connections") || 0
      },
      errors: {
        build_failures: count_build_errors,
        deployment_failures: count_deployment_errors,
        websocket_drops: count_websocket_errors
      }
    }
  end
end
```

### Alert Thresholds
| Metric | Warning | Critical | Action |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Preview Deploy Time P50 | >15s | >30s | Scale build servers |
| Preview Deploy Time P95 | >30s | >60s | Investigate slow builds |
| HMR Success Rate | <90% | <80% | Check WebSocket health |
| Build Error Rate | >5% | >10% | Review error logs |
| WebSocket Connections | >5000 | >10000 | Scale Redis cluster |

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Real-time metrics
watch -n 5 'bin/rails runner "pp FastDeploymentMetrics.current_stats"'

# WebSocket health
bin/rails c
> ActionCable.server.connections.map(&:statistics)

# Redis memory usage
redis-cli INFO memory

# Sidekiq queue depth
bin/rails c
> Sidekiq::Queue.all.map { |q| [q.name, q.size] }
```

## Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- [ ] Preview deployment P50 > 30s for 10 minutes
- [ ] Error rate > 10% for 5 minutes
- [ ] WebSocket connection failures > 50%
- [ ] Redis memory > 90%

### Manual Rollback Procedure
```bash
# 1. Disable feature flag immediately
bin/rails c
> Flipper.disable(:fast_deployment)

# 2. Clear Redis cache
> Rails.cache.clear

# 3. Restart services
sudo systemctl restart rails
sudo systemctl restart sidekiq

# 4. Verify old system working
> App.last.deploy_via_github_actions!
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Redis cluster overload | Medium | High | Pre-scale, monitor memory |
| WebSocket connection storms | Low | High | Rate limiting, gradual rollout |
| ESBuild compilation errors | Medium | Medium | Fallback to webpack |
| Cloudflare API limits | Low | High | Request quota increase |
| User confusion | Medium | Low | In-app tutorials, documentation |

### Contingency Plans

#### If Redis Overloads
1. Increase Redis cluster size
2. Implement connection pooling
3. Add read replicas
4. Consider Redis Enterprise

#### If WebSockets Fail
1. Fall back to polling
2. Reduce reconnection frequency
3. Implement exponential backoff
4. Consider AnyCable for scale

#### If Build Times Degrade
1. Add more build servers
2. Increase cache TTL
3. Implement build queuing
4. Pre-compile common dependencies
