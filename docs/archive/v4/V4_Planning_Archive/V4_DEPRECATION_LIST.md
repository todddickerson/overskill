## üìù Migration Notes

1. **Before deleting**: Ensure no active apps depend on CDN approach
2. **Backup**: Keep a backup branch with old files
3. **Update imports**: Check all controllers/jobs for references
4. **Test**: Verify V4 works before removing V3
5. **Documentation**: Update all user-facing docs

---

## üéØ End Goal

After cleanup:
- ONE orchestrator (AppBuilderV4)
- ONE build system (Vite)
- ONE file structure (pages/components)
- ONE deployment pipeline (Build ‚Üí Worker)
- NO confusion between modes
