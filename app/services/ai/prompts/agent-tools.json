      "description": "Line-Based Search and Replace Tool\n\nUse this tool to find and replace specific content in a file you have access to, using explicit line numbers. This is the PREFERRED and PRIMARY tool for editing existing files. Always use this tool when modifying existing code rather than rewriting entire files.\n\nProvide the following details to make an edit:\n\t1.\tfile_path - The path of the file to modify\n\t2.\tsearch - The content to search for (use ellipsis ... for large sections instead of writing them out in full)\n\t3.\tfirst_replaced_line - The line number of the first line in the search (1-indexed)\n\t4.\tlast_replaced_line - The line number of the last line in the search (1-indexed)\n\t5.\treplace - The new content to replace the found content\n\nThe tool will validate that search matches the content at the specified line range and then replace it with replace.\n\nIMPORTANT: When invoking this tool multiple times in parallel (multiple edits to the same file), always use the original line numbers from the file as you initially viewed it. Do not adjust line numbers based on previous edits.\n\nELLIPSIS USAGE:\nWhen replacing sections of code longer than ~6 lines, you should use ellipsis (...) in your search to reduce the number of lines you need to specify (writing fewer lines is faster).\n- Include the first few lines (typically 2-3 lines) of the section you want to replace\n- Add \"...\" on its own line to indicate omitted content\n- Include the last few lines (typically 2-3 lines) of the section you want to replace\n- The key is to provide enough unique context at the beginning and end to ensure accurate matching\n- Focus on uniqueness rather than exact line counts - sometimes 2 lines is enough, sometimes you need 4\n\n\n\nExample:\nTo replace a user card component at lines 22-42:\n\nOriginal content in file (lines 20-45):\n20: return (\n21: <div className=\"user-list\">\n22: <div className=\"user-card\">\n23: <img src={user.avatar} alt=\"User avatar\" />\n24: <h3>{user.name}</h3>\n25: <p>{user.email}</p>\n26: <p>{user.role}</p>\n27: <p>{user.department}</p>\n28: <p>{user.location}</p>\n29: <div className=\"user-actions\">\n30: <button onClick={() => onEdit(user.id)}>Edit</button>\n31: <button onClick={() => onDelete(user.id)}>Delete</button>\n32: <button onClick={() => onView(user.id)}>View</button>\n33: </div>\n34: <div className=\"user-metadata\">\n35: <span>Created: {user.createdAt}</span>\n36: <span>Updated: {user.updatedAt}</span>\n37: <span>Status: {user.status}</span>\n38: </div>\n39: <div className=\"user-permissions\">\n40: <span>Permissions: {user.permissions.join(', ')}</span>\n41: </div>\n42: </div>\n43: </div>\n44: );\n45: }\n\nFor a large replacement like this, you must use ellipsis:\n- search: \" <div className=\\\"user-card\\\">\\n <img src={user.avatar} alt=\\\"User avatar\\\" />\\n...\\n <span>Permissions: {user.permissions.join(', ')}</span>\\n </div>\\n </div>\"\n- first_replaced_line: 22\n- last_replaced_line: 42\n- replace: \" <div className=\\\"user-card enhanced\\\">\\n <div className=\\\"user-avatar\\\">\\n <img \\n src={user.avatar} \\n alt=\\\"User profile picture\\\" \\n className=\\\"avatar-image\\\"\\n onError={(e) => {\\n e.currentTarget.src = '/default-avatar.png';\\n }}\\n />\\n </div>\\n <div className=\\\"user-info\\\">\\n <h3 className=\\\"user-name\\\">{user.name}</h3>\\n <p className=\\\"user-email\\\">{user.email}</p>\\n <div className=\\\"user-details\\\">\\n <span className=\\\"user-role\\\">{user.role}</span>\\n <span className=\\\"user-department\\\">{user.department}</span>\\n </div>\\n </div>\\n <div className=\\\"user-actions\\\">\\n <button \\n className=\\\"edit-button\\\" \\n onClick={() => onEdit(user.id)}\\n aria-label=\\\"Edit user profile\\\"\\n >\\n Edit Profile\\n </button>\\n </div>\\n </div>\"\n\nCritical guidelines:\n\t1. Line Numbers - Specify exact first_replaced_line and last_replaced_line (1-indexed, first line is line 1)\n\t2. Ellipsis Usage - For large sections (>6 lines), use ellipsis (...) to include only the first few and last few key identifying lines for cleaner, more focused matching\n\t3. Content Validation - The prefix and suffix parts of search (before and after ellipsis) must contain exact content matches from the file (without line numbers). The tool validates these parts against the actual file content\n\t4. File Validation - The file must exist and be readable\n\t5. Parallel Tool Calls - When multiple edits are needed, invoke necessary tools simultaneously in parallel. Do NOT wait for one edit to complete before starting the next\n\t6. Original Line Numbers - When making multiple edits to the same file, always use original line numbers from your initial view of the file",
