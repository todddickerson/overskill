## Current Issues & Next Priorities

### **IMMEDIATE - Chat Form Still Not Submitting**
- [ ] **DEBUG: Chat form submission** - Form reaches "Submitting form..." but doesn't hit server
  - Enhanced form submission logic is in place but not working
  - Need to debug why requestSubmit()/submit() isn't reaching Rails controller
  - May need to investigate Turbo form handling or CSRF issues
  - Console shows: "Submit called, processing: false" → "Submitting form..." but no server logs

### **High Priority - Production Scale**
- [ ] **Cloudflare Workers Migration**: Real Node.js runtime for previews
  - Replace Rails preview with proper Worker environments
  - Native JavaScript execution without MIME type issues
  - Better performance and isolation
  
- [ ] **Deploy Button**: One-click deployment to unique subdomains
  - Generate unique subdomains: `{app-name}.overskill.app`
  - Push to Cloudflare Workers with R2 asset storage
  - Environment variables management

### **Medium Priority - Developer Experience**  
- [ ] **CodeMirror Diff View**: Visual version comparison
  - Show file changes between versions
  - Side-by-side diff visualization
  - Merge conflict resolution
  
- [ ] **AI Suggestion Buttons**: Follow-up action recommendations
  - "Add mobile responsiveness"
  - "Improve accessibility" 
  - "Add dark mode"
  - Smart context-aware suggestions

### **Medium Priority - Collaboration**
- [ ] **GitHub Integration**: Export to repositories
  - GitHub OAuth flow
  - Create repository from app
  - Push app files to GitHub
  - Two-way sync between app files and repo

### **Low Priority - Enterprise Features**
- [ ] **Custom Domains**: User-provided domain support
- [ ] **Team Collaboration**: Real-time collaborative editing
- [ ] **API Access**: External integrations and webhooks
- [ ] **Analytics**: Usage tracking and performance metrics

## Next Session Focus 🚀

**URGENT: Chat form submission debugging needed!** Current priorities:

1. **DEBUG Chat Form**: Investigate why form reaches "Submitting form..." but doesn't hit Rails server
2. **Investigate**: Turbo form handling, CSRF tokens, form element references
3. **Once fixed**: Resume Cloudflare Workers migration and Deploy Button features

## Recent Session Summary (2025-08-01)

### ✅ **Completed**
- Fixed status_text method visibility in AppChatMessage model
- Enhanced chat form controller with comprehensive submission logic
- Added database constraints and periodic cleanup for stuck messages
- Implemented automatic app logo generation with DALL-E
- Fixed dark/light mode styling issues across all components
- Enhanced version history modal with proper controller scoping
- Added comprehensive error handling and timeout mechanisms
- Updated OverSkill branding integration in generated apps

### ❌ **Still Broken**
- **Chat form submission**: Form JavaScript executes but doesn't reach Rails controller
- Need debugging of form element, Turbo streams, or CSRF handling
