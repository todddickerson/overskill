## üìã Week 3 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Custom Domains (Days 1-2)
1. Create CustomDomainManager service
2. Integrate Cloudflare Zone API
3. Add domain validation and setup
4. Test custom domain routing

### Phase 2: SSL Automation (Days 3-4)
1. Implement SSL certificate automation
2. Configure HTTPS enforcement
3. Add certificate renewal monitoring
4. Test with real domains

### Phase 3: Production Optimization (Days 5-7)
1. Enhanced Vite configuration
2. Asset optimization pipeline
3. Performance monitoring
4. Load testing and validation

## üéØ Success Metrics for Week 3

### Performance Targets
- **Production Build Time**: <3 seconds
- **Asset Optimization**: <1MB total bundle
- **Custom Domain Setup**: <60 seconds automated
- **SSL Certificate**: <30 seconds provision

### User Experience Targets  
- **Custom Domain**: User provides domain, automatic setup
- **Production URLs**: Professional URLs for deployed apps
- **SSL Security**: Automatic HTTPS for all deployments
- **Performance**: Optimized loading for all app types

### Technical Targets
- **Secrets API**: Working environment variable injection
- **DNS Management**: Automated DNS configuration
- **Error Handling**: Robust custom domain error recovery
- **Monitoring**: Real-time deployment health checks

## üö® Known Issues to Address

### High Priority
1. **Secrets API**: PATCH method permission issue
2. **Custom Domains**: No current implementation
3. **Production Builds**: Only preview builds working

### Medium Priority  
1. **Asset CDN**: R2 integration needs setup
2. **Monitoring**: No health checks implemented
3. **DNS**: Manual domain configuration required

### Low Priority
1. **Build Caching**: Could improve build performance
2. **Asset Minification**: Additional optimization possible
3. **Error Pages**: Custom 404/500 pages for apps

## ‚ú® Week 3 Vision

**End of Week 3 Goal**: 
> Users can generate professional React apps with AI, deploy them to custom domains with automatic SSL, and get production-optimized performance - all through natural language chat interface.

**Success Scenario**:
```
User: "Create a todo app and deploy it to my domain myapp.com"

System: 
1. ‚úÖ Generates React todo app with AI
2. ‚úÖ Builds optimized production bundle  
3. ‚úÖ Deploys to Cloudflare Workers
4. ‚úÖ Sets up custom domain routing
5. ‚úÖ Provisions SSL certificate
6. ‚úÖ Configures DNS automatically
7. ‚úÖ App live at https://myapp.com

Total Time: <5 minutes end-to-end
```

**V4 will be production-ready for real users! üöÄ**
